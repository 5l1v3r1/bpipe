=========== Changes for Bpipe Version 0.2 ============
    fixed exit code not displaying when command fails

    fixed / finished support for explicit config as part
    of exec command

    added test cases for more features in withconfig test

    added normal build directory to class path when running
    in situ in build direcory instead of eclipse build path

    show more info when in debug mode

    removed garbled test

    fixed test breaking due to bad file name

    added display of classpath when debug mode enabled

    fixed many tests failing because missing variable
    echoing enabled even for lazy resolved properties -
    missing variables now only echoed when would not
    otherwise resolve.

    fixed nested parallel pipelines throwing errors /
    not working

    fixed Cygwin displaying errors from ps / kill when
    terminating with Ctrl+C

    added regression test for nested parallel pipelines

    Fixed failures on Cygwin for commands with spaces and
    also containing double quotes inside exec calls

    Experimental:  variables inside pipeline stages
    now always output their name when not defined.
    This allows passthrough inside "exec" calls so that
    statements like 'for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i ; done'
    will work rather than throwing the mystifying error
    that i is not defined.

    support for forwarding stdout and stderr in real time
    from torque jobs

    support for bpipe.config entries to use top level
    entries as defaults, lower entries only override top
    level ones

    support for walltime to be specified as executable
    closure that returns integer

    minor improvements to formatting and messaging

    added missing file for running withconfig test

    added support for individual cleanup scripts for tests
    Removed unwanted log file

    added test for custom command executors

    fixes for custom command executors under Cygwin
    (explicitly invoking bash)

    More work towards getting abstracted command executors
    working
