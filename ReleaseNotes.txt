=========== Changes for Bpipe Version 0.9.1 ============

    --------: Updated to groovy 1.8.6

    Issue 17: Composable Pipelines - Ability to Define
              Reusable Pipeline Segments

    Issue 9:  Pipeline file can't have same name as
              pipeline stage

    -------:  Added printout of job directory when running 'bpipe
              jobs'

    -------:  added check to ensure that no existing pipeline is
              running in a directory when starting a new one

    Issue 15: Output from commands like 'bpipe test'
              or printing help should not become the most recent log

    Issue 16: Ability to resolve multiple files using
              input variable with extensions

    Issue 11: 'bpipe log' shows output from runs
              even when Bpipe didn't successfully start - fixed
              regression, bpipe log incorrectly showing job as
              finished

    --------: made output from 'bpipe log' adjust number of lines
              displayed according to terminal height

    Issue 4:  Bpipe log command hangs requiring Ctrl-C
              when Job is Finished

    --------: fixed spurious semilcolon prepended to command when
              leading blank lines inlcuded

    --------: changed various thread pools to create daemon threads to
              prevent java process living on after bpipe exits

    --------: numerous measures to use less file handles and avoid
              leaking / holding open file handles to prevent issues
              running where file handles are constrained

    Issue 14: Support for Detecting when Commands have
              Changed in Rerunning Pipeline (disabled by default, to
              enable set flag in bpipe.config).

    Issue 13: Bpipe should offer some way to control how
              many threads it will create

    Issue 12: Deadlock and Corrupted Command Log when
              running huge number of Parallel Stages (>100)

=========== Changes for Bpipe Version 0.2 ============
    fixed exit code not displaying when command fails

    fixed / finished support for explicit config as part
    of exec command

    added test cases for more features in withconfig test

    added normal build directory to class path when running
    in situ in build direcory instead of eclipse build path

    show more info when in debug mode

    removed garbled test

    fixed test breaking due to bad file name

    added display of classpath when debug mode enabled

    fixed many tests failing because missing variable
    echoing enabled even for lazy resolved properties -
    missing variables now only echoed when would not
    otherwise resolve.

    fixed nested parallel pipelines throwing errors /
    not working

    fixed Cygwin displaying errors from ps / kill when
    terminating with Ctrl+C

    added regression test for nested parallel pipelines

    Fixed failures on Cygwin for commands with spaces and
    also containing double quotes inside exec calls

    Experimental:  variables inside pipeline stages
    now always output their name when not defined.
    This allows passthrough inside "exec" calls so that
    statements like 'for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i ; done'
    will work rather than throwing the mystifying error
    that i is not defined.

    support for forwarding stdout and stderr in real time
    from torque jobs

    support for bpipe.config entries to use top level
    entries as defaults, lower entries only override top
    level ones

    support for walltime to be specified as executable
    closure that returns integer

    minor improvements to formatting and messaging

    added missing file for running withconfig test

    added support for individual cleanup scripts for tests
    Removed unwanted log file

    added test for custom command executors

    fixes for custom command executors under Cygwin
    (explicitly invoking bash)

    More work towards getting abstracted command executors
    working
