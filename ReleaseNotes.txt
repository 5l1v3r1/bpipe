=========== Changes for Bpipe Version 0.9.8_beta_1 ============

-   More flexible model for concurrency management, enabling
    management of any kind of resource. Introduction of
    new keyword "uses" to declare resource usage for a block
    and command line options (-m, -l, -n) to control different
    aspects of concurrency

-   Complete re-implementation of dependency analysis so that
    Bpipe understands the depedency graph and can perform
    transitive dependency analysis to allow rerunning piplines
    without rebuilding unnecessary intermediate dependencies.
    (See Issue #2, http://code.google.com/p/bpipe/issues/detail?id=2)
    Includes support for new command line commands, 
    "bpipe query", "bpipe cleanup", and "bpipe preserve" to 
    display and manage dependencies, as well as annotations,
    "@preserved" to declare dependencies that should not be
    deleted in a "cleanup". 

-   support for new 'glob' function available within
    pipeline stages to facilitate pipelines that need to
    use wild card matches on input files.

-   Annotations can be used with lower case now. Upper case 
    still works, but some people feel @transform, @filter,
    etc. looks nicer.

-   Support for parallelizing by chromosome on existing
    files already split by chromosome. If your input files
    are split and named by chromosome, you can use 
    filterInputs parameter to make the existing
    files be used for inputs to the parallelization 
    eg. chr(1..2, filterInputs:true) 

-   Many various bug fixes and improvements to messaging,
    behaviour and output.
